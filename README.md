# Central Tendency Analysis â€“ Wine Quality (Python)

A short case study using the Wine Quality dataset to compute and explain measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and visualize distributions.

## Dataset
- Public Wine Quality dataset (red/white). Include CSV source.

## Steps Performed
1. Load data
2. Compute mean, median, mode for key acidity variables
3. Visualize distributions
4. Summarize findings

## Key Results (from my run)
- Mean Fixed Acidity: **6.854**
- Mean Volatile Acidity: **0.2782**
- Mean Citric Acid: **0.3341**
- Most Frequent Quality Score (mode): **6**

## How to Run
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open `Central_Tendency_Wine_Quality.ipynb` in Jupyter/Colab and run all cells.

## Notes
- Central tendency choice (mean/median/mode) depends on data type and distribution.
